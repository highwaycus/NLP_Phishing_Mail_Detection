### Competition
The Crossroads Classic Analytics Challenge was established in 2021 by faculty at universities in Indiana that love their school, students, and the great State of Indiana. The teams were from Indiana University, Purdue University, Butler University and Notre Dame University. There are total 29 teams had submitted their work. Our team members were Shiue-Yuan Chuang and Andrew Huang, and we got the top four placements among the teams in Indiana University and advanced to the semi-final round.

### Problem Statement
Phishing is the most popular form of social engineering and can be leveraged to put malware or ransomware into a companyâ€™s environment. MISO performs routine phishing tests to make sure their employees are ready and prepared. ECS helps protect companies from cyber threats every day, and IN3 helps bring people together to create a hub of national security innovation to help solve critical defense priorities. How can data science and predictive analytics help employees gain confidence in receiving emails that they are real? (https://crossroadsclassicanalyticschallenge.com/)
